# PyBer Analysis Report

## Background and Results

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to give the ride sharing company Pyber analysis of its ride data to improve its service to customers and grow its business.  
  
### Technical Analysis
  This required importingt raw data files into dataframes to be analyzed. Analysis on the dataframes included insuring the data was cleaned and merged, sorting and grouping the data by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban).  Descriptive statistics were computed for different ride data by city type.  Finally, graphic visuals of the data were generated using matplotlib.

### Results
Table 1: Summary of ride data by city type.

### Summary
Analysis of Figure 1 shows a farely steady use of Pyber rides over time by each city type, with only minor changes in the fares collected up or down over time.  The disparity in total fares collected over time by city type is stark between Urban/Suburban areas and Rural areas.  Table 1 confirms this disparity also in both the number of rides taken and the number of drivers in Urban/Suburban areas versus Rural areas.  Pyber should investigate the underlying causes of this disparity since the Table 1 indicates that average fare per ride and per driver are higher in Rural areas.  It should be determined if customers would increase their use of the service if more drivers were available.  Ride length data should be gathered to help identify if the length of the ride is the cause of the increased average fare.

## Challenges Encountered and Overcome
I encountered the most challenges with manipulating the data by the type of data structure encountered.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* Programming
Extracting/Inserting data into series and dataframes efficiently. Finding and applying the correct syntax for the method needed.
* Data analysis
Once the correct method was selected with the correct syntax the data analysis was very straight forward.
* Graphing, etc
Generating graphical analysis was fairly straight forward, although many customizations are available that leave a number of details left to be discovered.
